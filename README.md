Building Research Agents with Agentic RAG

Project Overview

This project is an exploration into Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where I focused on creating intelligent research agents capable of reasoning over documents and answering complex questions. Through this journey, I learned to build and extend agents that can navigate, summarize, and compare information across multiple documents, using advanced techniques like prompt engineering, tool calling, and reinforcement learning.

Notebooks Overview

1. Building a Router Agent

	•	Objective: Develop a basic router agent that selects between Q&A and summarization engines based on the given query.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Implemented a simple agentic RAG router to execute queries over a single document.
	•	Explored how the router decides which query engine to use based on the input.

2. Extending the Router with Tool Calling

	•	Objective: Enhance the router agent by adding the ability to use an LLM to infer and pass arguments to functions.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Integrated tool calling into the agent, allowing it to choose functions and pass appropriate arguments.
	•	Experimented with LLMs to improve the agent’s decision-making process.

3. Building a Research Assistant Agent

	•	Objective: Create a research assistant agent capable of reasoning over tools in multiple steps.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Developed an agent that can conduct multi-step reasoning to handle more complex queries.
	•	Implemented the ability to engage with tools iteratively to refine the results.

4. Developing a Multi-Document Agent

	•	Objective: Extend the research agent to handle and analyze multiple documents.
	•	Key Activities:
	•	Built an agent that can compare, summarize, and draw conclusions from multiple research papers.
	•	Enhanced the agent’s ability to adapt its strategy based on initial findings to improve data retrieval.

Technologies Used

	•	Agentic RAG Framework: A framework designed for building research agents with reasoning and decision-making capabilities.
	•	Hugging Face Transformers: Used to implement and fine-tune the language models within the agents.
	•	Python: The primary programming language used throughout the project.
	•	PyTorch: The deep learning framework used to develop and train the models.
	•	LlamaIndex: A tool used to structure and query data, crucial for building intelligent agents.

Key Concepts and Techniques Learned

	•	Prompt Engineering: Crafting effective prompts to guide the agents’ behavior.
	•	Tool Calling: Enabling agents to select and pass arguments to functions autonomously.
	•	Multi-Step Reasoning: Building agents that can iteratively engage with tools and data.
	•	Multi-Document Analysis: Developing agents that can handle and synthesize information from multiple sources.
	•	Reinforcement Learning: Applying techniques like PPO to optimize the agents’ decision-making processes.
